                <h2>About Chuck Zipkin</h2>
				<img src="i/crz4.jpg" style="float:left;width:250px;margin:15px">
					<p>Chuck Zipkin practiced medicine in the Bay Area for 35 years, where he served as the hospital’s chief of medicine and chair of the Quality Assurance Committee. He built and managed the first free-standing endoscopy center and introduced new technologies in gastroenterology to the area. Upon becoming a full-time resident in Truckee, he continued his practice of medicine at Tahoe Forest Hospital for 5 years and worked as medical director of the local hospice program.</p>
					<p>Since retiring from practice, Zipkin has continued to give back to the medical community as chair of medical education for the hospital staff and medical students. He also works as medical director for the Community Health and Wellness Program, delivering 21st century health care to the people of our region, and is responsible for the annual Colon Cancer Awareness Month educational program.</p>
					<p>Previously, Chuck was an associate professor of medicine at The University of California at San Francisco, where he completed his training in gastroenterology. Prior to serving in the United States Air Force, he earned a BS from The University of California at Berkeley and an MD from The University of California at Irvine. He and his wife, Janet, share a passion for community service and have been volunteers for the Truckee Donner Land Trust, Truckee River Watershed Council, Sierra College’s lecture series, Tahoe Forest Hospital, Tahoe Donner Association, and support several other worthy local non-profits. They and their 5 children have enjoyed all the advantages of this beautiful place since they first owned property in Truckee in 1984.</p>

                    <h2>Candidate's Statement</h2>

<p>
Don’t let the discussion of our community health needs be hijacked by controversy surrounding the CEO or the cost of an MRI. We have real health crises in our District and we need to have the Board focus on its primary responsibilities: keeping the health care system functioning at a high level to serve the needs of the population. Our outstanding doctors deal with serious medical problems every day. Particularly pressing is teen and adolescent suicide and self-injury, which is epidemic in Placer County. High rates of childhood obesity and diabetes result in lifelong health issues. Alcoholism and its complications are endemic throughout our community. These and other serious chronic diseases need preventive care to reduce frequent hospitalizations, and decrease costs. 
Unfortunately, cancer will be a more common problem as our population ages and baby boomers retire to the District.  I want to know our patients will not need to go elsewhere for treatment should they need it at a time of personal crises.
<br><br>
<b>The Real Issue</b><br>
The real issue in this election is this--do we want an acute care hospital in our district?  We do. While reaching out to the community to listen to your concerns, I heard key messages come through: keep our hospital open 24/7; continue needed services, especially obstetrics and the ER; and stay current with 21st century medicine.  Medical charges are high everywhere and some of our neighbors will choose to go to Tahoe Forest’s competitors to save money. This happens all across the country. Tahoe Forest cannot compete with free-standing centers on price. The hospital competes on convenience and quality, and does very well on both, winning awards and recognition nationally. Trying to compete on price is impossible and will lead to closure of services, most likely obstetrics and the Emergency Room, which lose money now. Do you want your daughter to have to go to Sacramento to deliver her baby? Don’t be misled, hospitals close all the time trying to compete on price. As you may be aware, Seton Hospital in Daly City and San Pablo Community Hospital are closing now for financial reasons. I have a plan to help our patients in financial need, and will fight for it when I am on the Board. 
<br><br>
<b>My Financial Plan</b><br>
We can provide help in the billing office to adjust the bill and arrange payment programs for residents with financial need. We can assist in investigating insurance through Covered California Exchange to see if residents qualify for federal subsidies. We should educate patients that routine tests (mammograms and colonoscopies) now are done without co-pays or deductibles and can be done locally without charge to the patient. I would encourage the administration to strengthen our outreach for nicotine cessation, increase immunization rates, broaden the scope of education on diabetes and other preventative services to reduce medical bills. I pledge to critically review contracts and programs to be sure they remain cost effective and are of continued value to the community. I believe any CEO bonus should be based only on patient outcomes data, not the financial bottom line.
<br><br>
<b>Long Term Effects</b><br>
We need to remember that the hospital employs over 700 people and is a major driver of our local economy. People moving here always ask the realtor two questions, “how good are the schools and how good is the local health care?” Losing money on each patient by competing on price with free-standing centers cannot be made up by increasing volume. Reducing charges for one patient means reducing them for all, resulting in a shortfall that can only result in job loss, a reduction in our bond rating and closure of services. Our tax base will suffer from lost wages and fewer home sales if the hospital fails, and the effect on local resorts would be significant.
<br><br>
<b>Transparency and Communication</b><br>
I will encourage community input and comment. I will televise the meetings and avoid too frequent use of closed session. I will make it the Board’s job to make sure you know about programs that can lower your costs. I will be visible and engaged in community affairs and will hold informational meetings for the public so I can listen to your concerns, separate from the constraints of a regular Board Meeting. I will not be a rubber stamp on the Board. I will have an independent voice.
<br><br>
<b>My Service</b><br>
I have practiced medicine for 40 years both here and in the Bay Area. I have been Medical Director of Hospice and Chair of Medical Education at Tahoe Forest Hospital.
I am proud of, and passionate about, my role as Medical Director for Community Health and Wellness Neighborhood. I am an independent contractor to the district, not an employee, and am paid a small stipend to provide medical expertise to the Executive Director. I am paid from tax funds, not operations, and am responsible to the District tax payers, not the CEO. My allegiance is to the improved health of the people in the District where I live, and I intend to continue providing that when I am on the Board.
<br><br>
<b>Bottom Line</b><br>
This election is about the continued operation of an outstanding hospital that provides excellent service to all of us. Put me on the Board!
